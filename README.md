# GES Health Study Interactive Maps Application
The code in this repository was used to develop the GES Health Study Interactive 
Maps application. More information about the GES Health Study
is available on our [project website](http://geshealthstudy.org).

This project is a collaboration between the GES Health Study Community Council 
(Nancy Santos, Dolores Alfaro, and Ana Varela) and the ENVIRONS team (Dr. Sheryl
Magzamen, Dr. Sheena Martenies, Beth Lunsford, Nona Nyhart, Anna Kenyon, and Rocio 
Monroy-Tello). Former members of the GES Community Council who contributed to the 
interpretation of community data featured in this tool include: Sandra Ruiz 
Parilla, Maria de Santiago, and Rebecca Trujillo. Marshall Thomas (former ENVIRONS 
team member) also contributed to the development of the data sets used in this tool.
